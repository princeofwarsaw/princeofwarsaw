- 👋 Hi, I’m @princeofwarsaw
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, technology, true crime, live music, festivals, and now apparently web develpoment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics through The Odin Project.  I will update accordingly once I feel I've reached a desired skill level with each language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.  Once I've got a project, I will update.
